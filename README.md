# SQL Movie Database Project_2

## Case Study:
A Data Analyst and their business partner were recently approached by another local business owner who is interested in purchasing "Maven Movies". The prospective investor primarily owns restaurants and bars, so he has lots of questions for the analyst about their business and the "rental business" in general. His offer seems very generous, so they are going to entertain and listen to his questions.

## Objective:
To leverage SQL skills to extract and analyze data from various tables in the Maven Movies database for the purpose of answering the potential investor’s questions. Each question will require writing a multi-table SQL query, joining at least two tables.


## The project workflow follows the below key questions the prospective investor needs to be answered:
1. My partner and I want to come by each of the stores in person and meet the managers. Please send over the managers’ names at each store, with the full address of each property (street address, district, city, and country please).
2. I would like to get a better understanding of all of the inventory that would come along with the business. Please pull together a list of each inventory item you have stocked, including the store_id number, the inventory_id, the name of the film, the film’s rating, its rental rate and replacement cost.
3. From the same list of films you just pulled, please roll that data up and provide a summary level overview of your inventory. We would like to know how many inventory items you have with each rating at each store.
4. Similarly, we want to understand how diversified the inventory is in terms of replacement cost. We want to see how big of a hit it would be if a certain category of film became unpopular at a certain store. We would like to see the number of films, as well as the average replacement cost, and total replacement cost, sliced by store and film category.
5. We want to make sure you have a good handle on who your customers are. Please provide a list of all your customer names, which store they go to, whether or not they are currently active, and their full addresses – street address, city, and country.
6. We would like to understand how much your customers are spending with you, and also to know who your most valuable customers are. Please pull together a list of customer names, their total lifetime rentals, and the sum of all payments you have collected from them. It would be great to see this ordered on total lifetime value, with the most valuable customers at the top of the list.
7. My partner and I would like to get to know your board of advisors and any current investors. Could you please provide a list of advisor and investor names in one table? Could you please note whether they are an investor or an advisor, and for the investors, it would be good to include which company they work with.
8. We're interested in how well you have covered the most-awarded actors. Of all the actors with three types of awards, for what % of them do we carry a film? And how about for actors with two types of awards? Same questions. Finally, how about actors with just one award?


### Running the project:
1 -- MySQL Workbench or similar is needed. 2 -- Use the "create_mavenmovies.sql" database file to read data to the project script.
